# Rating-System-optimization-
This repository aims to conduct rating system optimization using `Wilson Score` according to business needs, so that the accuracy of the scoring system of a live broadcast platform can be higher, saving more resources for the platform to recommend more high-quality streamers to the homepage.

### Background
In the live broadcast industry, the major live-streaming platforms are more willing to recommend high-quality online streamers to the homepage of the website, thus to attract more users. But the accuracy of the old algorithm used by the project was only `80%`, which means that the `20%` of the streamers recommended by the system can hardly bring better benefits to the platform. So how to improve the accuracy of the scoring system is what the platform must do.

### Methodology
Suppose there are two videos in a live-streaming platform. One has 3 favors and 1 objection, the other has 30 favors and 10 objections. 
The approval rate of both answers is 75%. Which video should be ranked first?

In general, the normal approximation confidence interval for a sample is:
