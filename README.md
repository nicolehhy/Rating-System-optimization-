# Rating-System-optimization-
This repository aims to conduct rating system optimizatio using Wilson algorithm according to business needs, so that the accuracy of the scoring system of a live broadcast platform can be higher, saving more resources for the platform to recommend more high-quality streamers to the homepage.

### Background
In the live broadcast industry, the major live-streaming platforms are more willing to recommend high-quality online streamers to the homepage of the website, thus to attract more users. But the accuracy of the old algorithm used by the project was only 80%, which means that the 20% of the streamers recommended by the system can hardly bring better benefits to the platform. So how to improve the accuracy of the scoring system is what the platform must do.

### Research with the operation department
